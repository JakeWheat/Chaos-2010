= Introduction

An updated version of Chaos, a turn based spectrum game from 1985.

See wikipedia for information about the original game:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(video_game)

===============================================================================

= Game overview

Two to eight wizards battle each other. None, some or all can be
computer controlled, with the others controlled by human players.

The battleground is a grid 15x10 squares, the play is turn based. Each
wizard casts spells, and moves his army around to attack other wizards
and their armies.

When a wizard is killed all his monsters disappear. The game is won
when only one wizard remains.

Some spells summon monsters to be part of the wizards army, some
upgrade the wizard to be tougher, some spells attack other wizards or
monsters. Different spells have different likelihoods of success.

Each monster has different strengths, some can fly, some can attack
from a distance.

================================================================================

= Important notes

This is a pre-alpha version. You can play it but there are some minor
things missing (e.g. there is no line of sight calculation, and the
computer controlled opponents are a bit crap). Also, the ui is very
unpolished.

There is no installer, getting it running is a real challenge. (A
prebuilt windows exe to make windows installation much easier is a
priority).

You can try the original in an emulator:

Or to play a slick remake that runs in windows:

which is better than this version.

The file 'development_guide' gives a quick intro to the source code if
you are interested in that sort of thing.

================================================================================

= Installation instructions:

Currently, the skills you need are to be able to download and install
software from the internet or using your os's package manager, and to
be able to add a user and database to postgresql.

== from source

The prerequisites are:
Postgresql 8.4
gtk
ghc6.10, cabal, gtk2hs 0.10, and some libraries which cabal can install
  (sdl is cabal installable but the dev version is complicated to get
  working on windows)

Short version:
install and setup postgresql, you can use the script on windows,
or if you install it another way you need to add a user and database
install ghc, gtk2hs, cabal-install
get the source
install the project using cabal: unzip the files, and run 'cabal
install' from that folder
then you can run the chaos exe, as with the binary installation

You can get the prerequisites for windows from the following web sites:

ghc
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html

postgresql
http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgdownload.do#windows

gtk2hs
http://www.haskell.org/gtk2hs/download/

cabal-install exe
http://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html

[Warning: currently, install on windows takes ~100MB downloads and
another ~750MB of disk space when installed!]

Install them, you can accept the defaults during the installation on
all of these.

Get the cabal.exe linked from here:

You can stick it in the ghc bin folder, which is probably
C:\ghc\ghc-6.10.1\bin

The pg installer doesn't seem to put the pg bin folder in the path,
which cabal/HDBC-postgresql needs. Do this in
controlpanel/system/environment, the folder you want to add to the
path is probably C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.3\bin

For linux, I recommend using the package manager included with your
system to install all of the prerequisites (this might be apt-get or
rpm).  Not sure what do to on Mac os x, but if you can get the
prerequisites installed, there's not reason why the game shouldn't run
fine.
