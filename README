= Introduction

A clone of Chaos, a turn based spectrum game from 1985.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(video_game)

This is an pre-alpha version. You can play it but there are some minor
things missing, the main one being computer controlled
opponents. There is no installer, getting it running is a challenge.

You can try the original in an emulator:

Or to play a slick remake that runs in windows:

which is much better than this version.

===============================================================================

= Game overview

Two to eight wizards battle each other. None, some or all can be
computer controlled.

The battleground is a grid 15x10 squares, the play is turn based. Each
wizard casts spells, and moves his army around to attack other wizards
and their armies.

When a wizard is killed all his monsters disappear. The game is won
when only one wizard remains.

Some spells summon monsters to be part of the wizards army, some
upgrade the wizard to be tougher, some spells attack other wizards or
monsters. Different spells have different likelihoods of success.

Each monster has different strengths, some can fly, some can attack
from a distance.

================================================================================

= Prerequisites:

Postgresql 8.3+
gtk
ghc6.10 with the following packages:
  gtk2hs 0.10, hdbc, hdbc-postgresql, hunit, fez-conf, quickcheck, regexpr
  (these are all on cabal except gtk2hs)

If you are interested in the code see the file 'development_guide' file for more
information.

================================================================================

= Installation instructions:

== Windows

Rough guide, will be fleshed out more.

Warning: currently, install on windows takes ~100MB downloads and
another ~750MB of disk space when installed!

Get the latest windows installers for these:

http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html

http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgdownload.do#windows

http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/archives/2009/02/11/gtk2hs-version-0100-released/

You can accept the defaults during the installation on all of
these. Remember the password you used for postgresql.

Get the cabal.exe linked from here:

http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/CabalInstall

You can stick it in the ghc bin folder, which is probably
C:\ghc\ghc-6.10.1\bin

The pg installer doesn't seem to put the pg bin folder in the path,
which cabal/HDBC-postgresql needs. Do this in
controlpanel/system/environment, the folder you want to add to the
path is probably C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.3\bin

Now run
cabal install HDBC HDBC-postgresql HUnit fez-conf regexpr QuickCheck

Congratulations, you've installed the prerequisites.

You'll need to add a user with password to postgresql (todo: provide
links to help on this), create a database called chaos, and give the
added user access to this database.

If you have a irresponsible approach to security, you can skip adding
a postgresql user and database if you use the sa password you entered
during the postgresql install, the username for this will be
'postgres'. (DO NOT do this if you have any other postgresql databases
installed, or if your computer is ever connected to the internet or
any network. See the LICENSE file for a disclaimer.)

Unzip the source files for this project.

Edit the file chaos.config to put the username and password in.

to setup the database, run
runghc chaos.lhs setup

This only needs to be done once.

Then to play,
runghc chaos.lhs
