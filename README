= Introduction

An updated version of Chaos, a turn based spectrum game from 1985.

See wikipedia for information about the original game:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(video_game)

===============================================================================

= Game overview

Two to eight wizards battle each other. None, some or all can be
computer controlled, with the others controlled by human players.

The battleground is a grid 15x10 squares, the play is turn based. Each
wizard casts spells, and moves his army around to attack other wizards
and their armies.

When a wizard is killed all his monsters disappear. The game is won
when only one wizard remains.

Some spells summon monsters to be part of the wizards army, some
upgrade the wizard to be tougher, some spells attack other wizards or
monsters. Different spells have different likelihoods of success.

Each monster has different strengths, some can fly, some can attack
from a distance.

It isn't easy to install.

You can try the original in an emulator:

Or to play a slick remake that runs in windows:

which is better than this version.

Rough installation instructions:


If this looks like gobbledygook to you then I wouldn't recommend
trying.

Install haskell platform, postgresql.

createdb chaos

cabal unpack hssqlppp

You might have problems where hdbc-postgresql can't find the headers
and libs for postgresql, on windows, you can probably add something like
C:\Program-Files\PostgreSQL\8.4\bin
to the path.

ghc --make -threaded -XDeriveDataTypeable -iexamples:src  examples/HsSqlSystem.lhs && time examples/HsSqlSystem resetchaos >chaos1.sql && examples/HsSqlSystem clear --database=chaos && psql chaos -q --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on --file=chaos1.sql

install gtk2hs

cabal configure
cabal build
