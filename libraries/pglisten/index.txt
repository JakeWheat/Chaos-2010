tiny library to support listen for postgresql from haskell code

the planned api is something like

connect :: String -> IO LConn
disconnect :: LConn -> IO ()

listen :: LConn -> String -> IO ()
unlisten :: LConn -> String -> IO ()
read :: LConn -> IO String -- this blocks until a notify is available
