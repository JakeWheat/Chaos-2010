todo:
initial goal: tidy up code which is a massive mess:

split chaos2010 into many files
run tests from chaos2010 exe
fix arguments, setup, only look at cabal installations and forget exe for now

transition all ui code to be more declarative
use new hssqlppp + hlist wrappers + th for database access
split out any development utilities
split out development time dbms utilities into separate package or put in hssqlppp

review and rework sql code: use hssqlppp extensions instead of
dynamically generating pgsql from pgsql
change test code to be much more declarative

review all code and docs for other todos to tidy
