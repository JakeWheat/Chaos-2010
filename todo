credits/thanks
background reading
installation instructions:
complete instructions for installation and run from source for:
  ubuntu
  windows
plus if possible:
  debian
  fedora
  mac os x
investigate scripting installation as much as possible
automate setting conf, loading database, unix2dos when running chaos.lhs
platforms need ghc6.10, gtk2hs0.10 which includes windows but current release
  versions of debian, fedora and ubuntu don't have this yet
more tests?

================================================================================

= milestone beta 0.3

check out binary distribution
fix problems from beta 0.1

================================================================================

= milestone beta 0.4

possibles:
  improved installation
  basic save/load feature to dump and restore db to file
  switch to hide information - spell choice and imag/real
  in game manual and tutorials, what can I do now, why can't I do __ questions
    (goes with better constraint/error messages)
  visual and sound effects
  redesign ui - more spellbook and info widgets than board
  improved ai, multiple ais
  more tests
  multiple games without dump/restore, game manager
  sprite manager, or maybe load from zip file
  audit trail ish
  error reporting system
  decide whether this gets the program to 1.0 or not - 1.0 should be
    the first version that normal people can easily install and play
