Action validity
===============

All the updates in this database are via stored procs (um, functions
in postgres, called actions here), which are simple and modular. Each
'public' stored proc has precondition checks, which also double as a
guide to what the ui can do, so they are exact preconditions. So this
is seriously paranoid code - chaos is serious business.

All these views need a rethink, its a massive mess.

pieces on top
-------------

The topmost piece on each square is the one you interact with most of
the time, e.g. when selecting, attacking, etc.

The exception to this rule is when you select a wizard that is in a
magic tree or castle or mounted on a monster.

The pieces_on_top view also determines what sprite is shown in a
square in the ui
