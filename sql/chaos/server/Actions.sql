Individual Piece move notes
A piece may be 'selected' iff it can move or attack or has a ranged attack.

Once a piece is selected it must first move, then attack, then ranged
attack (skipping bits which don't apply).

The piece can forfeit any part of this (and can choose to move only
part of it's move if walking).

The parts must be in this strict order.

If a piece is unselected before it has moved or done anything then it
remains able to move this turn otherwise its move is over for this
